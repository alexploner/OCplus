  abstract = {Motivation: The false discovery rate (FDR) provides a key statistical assessment for
	 microarray studies. Its value depends on the proportion {pi}0 of
	 non-differentially expressed (nonDE) genes. In most microarray studies, many
	 genes have small effects not easily separable from nonDE genes. As a
	 result, current methods often overestimate {pi}0 and FDR, leading to
	 unnecessary loss of power in the overall analysis.Methods: For the common
	 two-sample comparison we derive a natural mixture model of the test
	 statistic and an explicit bias formula in the standard estimation of
	 {pi}0. We suggest an improved estimation of {pi}0 based on the mixture
	 model and describe a practical likelihood-based procedure for this
	 purpose.Results: The analysis shows that a large bias occurs when
	 {pi}0 is far from 1 and when the non-centrality parameters of the
	 distribution of nonDE genes are near zero. The theoretical result also
	 explains substantial discrepancies between nonparametric and model-based
	 estimates of {pi}0. Simulation studies indicate mixture-model estimates
	 are less biased than standard estimates. The method is applied to
	 breast cancer and lymphoma data examples.Availability: An R-package
	 OCplus containing functions to compute {pi}0 based on the mixture
	 model, the resulting FDR, and other operating characteristics of
	 microarray data, is freely available at http://www.meb.ki.se/~yudpaw.},
